The song “Objections to the Theory of Relativity,” sung by  Nogizaka 46, replaces the high-speed movement of a person with that of a train for the sake of ease of understanding, and objects to the existence of the concepts of relativistic time and relativistic distance. It also objects to the existence of the principle of the invariance of the speed of light and the existence of the limit that “nothing can exceed the speed of light,” concluding that “absolutely Einstein is wrong.” The song is a kind of parody, but it also teaches the essence of the problems with Einstein's theory of relativity. I hope that the appearance of this song will help popularize a new theory of relativity.
