After the experiments of Michelson and Morley (1887), Fitzgerald and Lorentz, based on their belief in the existence of the ether, showed that there could be a transformation, now called the Lorentz trans-formation, in the propagation of light to explain the experimental results. Einstein (1905) derived the Lorentz transformation under the principles of relativity and light speed invariance. It was given in a modified form of the Galilean transformation, a known coordinate transformation. As a result, the relativistic time and length are applied in physics. 

However, since Einstein's theory of relativity led to the Lorentz transformation for coordinate systems, its consequences were attributed to the theories of Fitzgerald and Lorentz, which assumed the existence of the ether. Einstein's theory of relativity thus leads to various paradoxes. Here, the author presents a new theory of relativity that does not lead to any paradoxes. 

This theory, which is the exact opposite of Einstein's theory of relativity, asserts the absoluteness of time and length and uses the Galilean transformation as a coordinate transformation law. Based on the coordinate transformations, Lorentz transformations are constructed as the transformation laws of electro-magnetic theory. 

Dynamics and electromagnetics using electromagnetic waves such as light for obser-vation are defined as relativistic dynamics and relativistic electromagnetics. Newton's laws of motion are modified under Galilean transformations as the laws of motion for a stationary object until it acquires an infinitesimal velocity. 

The new theory of relativity correctly explains all previous results of physics experiments. This paper integrates the contents of Refs. 3), 4), and 5) and is presented here in English. Further details are given in Ref. 5) in Japanese.
